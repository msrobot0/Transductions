##### setting up your midi output

In order to hear something you need to have a midi output. There is a [great readme](http://www.euterpea.com/euterpea/setting-up-midi/) on the Euterpea(http://www.euterpea.com)
website. But if you are using a mac, like I am, just install [SimpleSynth](http://notahat.com/simplesynth/) and fiddle with your [Audio Midi setup](http://www.donyaquick.com/working-with-midi-on-mac-os-x/). Then you are ready to go!
